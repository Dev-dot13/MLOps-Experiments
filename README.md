**This repository contains Experiments related to Machine Learning Operations.**
Following is the list of experiments:

**exp2:**
Model Training and Versioning using a Simple Dataset: In this assignment, we worked with a small dataset (e.g., the Iris dataset) to build and manage versions of a basic machine learning model. Tasks Performed:
i.	Data Preparation:
ii.	Model Training:
iii.	Hyperparameter Tuning:
iv.	Record the results for comparison.
v.	Model Versioning: Save each trained model as a separate version using meaningful filenames (e.g., model_v1.pkl, model_v2.pkl).

**exp3:**
Saving and Reusing a Machine Learning Model: In this assignment, we trained a machine learning model using a simple dataset and learned how to save and reuse the model without retraining. Tasks Performed:
i.	Train a Model:
ii.	Save the Model:
iii.	Reuse the Model:

**exp4:**
Creating a Reproducible ML Pipeline using Jupyter and Virtual Environment: Tasks Performed:
i.	Set up a virtual environment using venv or conda.
ii.	Install necessary libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.
iii.	Create a Jupyter notebook that:
iv.	Loads a dataset (e.g., Titanic, Wine).
v.	Performs data preprocessing.
vi.	Trains a simple model.
vii.	Save the notebook and environment dependencies (requirements.txt).
viii.	Share the notebook and environment setup on GitHub for others to reproduce.

**exp5:**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Report Generation: Tasks Performed:
i.	Choose a public dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI Repository).
ii.	Perform data cleaning, null value handling, and visualization using seaborn or matplotlib.
iii.	Generate insights like correlations, distributions, and outliers.
iv.	Export the EDA results as a PDF report (use nbconvert, matplotlib, or pandas_profiling).
v.	Commit the EDA notebook and report to your GitHub repository.

**exp6:**
Visualizing Model Performance: Tasks Performed:
i.	Train a binary classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression).
ii.	Plot and save:
iii.	Confusion matrix
iv.	Precision-Recall curve
v.	Compare performance between two models and explain which one is better.
vi.	Save all visualizations in a results/ directory in your repo.
